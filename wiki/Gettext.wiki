#summary How to localize Seaside applications using gettext.

Add your content here.  Format your content with:
  * Text in *bold* or _italic_
  * Headings, paragraphs, and lists
  * Automatic links to other wiki pages
html translate: 'text to translate'
html translate: 'other text to translate' to: aWALocale

which renders the translation. This has the problem that is doesn't
work for attributes, I'll need to come up with a solution for this,
API proposals are welcome.

= Workflow = 
 * write your application using the API above
 * register your domain. A domain is a way to group strings, you might
 * have Pier and a reporting application running in the same image and want each to use it's own dictionary: TextDomainManager registerCategoryPrefix: 'Seaside-Gettext-Examples' domain: 'gettext'
 *  export the template {{{
WAGetTextExporter new exportTemplate
}}}
 * create the translation files e.g. using poedit [2]
 * put the translation files in locale/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/<domain>.(po|mo)
 * done

One of the nice things about gettext is that there are external tools
like poedit [2] to manage the translation files which you can give to
your translators. No more need to mess around with Excel. There are
also tools [3] that display how much of your application is already
translated.
