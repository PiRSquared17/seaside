#summary How to localize Seaside applications using gettext.

= Introduction =

[http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ Gettext] is a library for "translating" applications to multiple languages. Seaside-Gettext allows you to use gettext from Seaside applications.


= Getting Started =
 # 

= API =


html translate: 'text to translate'
html translate: 'other text to translate' to: aWALocale

which renders the translation. This has the problem that is doesn't
work for attributes, I'll need to come up with a solution for this,
API proposals are welcome.

= Workflow = 
 # write your application using the API above
 # register your domain. A domain is a way to group strings, you might
 # have Pier and a reporting application running in the same image and want each to use it's own dictionary: {{{TextDomainManager registerCategoryPrefix: 'Seaside-Gettext-Examples' domain: 'gettext'}}}
 #  export the template {{{ WAGetTextExporter new exportTemplate }}}
 # create the translation files e.g. using [http://www.poedit.net/ poedit]
 # put the translation files in locale/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/<domain>.(po|mo)
 # done

One of the nice things about gettext is that there are external tools
like [http://www.poedit.net/ poedit]] to manage the translation files which you can give to
your translators. No more need to mess around with Excel. There are
also [http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/de/gnome-office/ui/ tools] that display how much of your application is already
translated.
