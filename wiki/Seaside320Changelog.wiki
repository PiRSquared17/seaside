= Features =
 * In Pharo the web based class browser will use Nautilus if available (Pharo 2+).

= Breaking Changes =
 * the type of an input element is no longer in its class
  * you have to change the CSS selector of the input type eg `.checkbox` to `[type='checkbox']`
 * inline JavaScript in XHTML in XML mode will no longer work
 * we no longer ship JavaScript libraries for generating and parsing JSON
 * server adapter authors should send `#rfc6265String` instead of #`oldNetscapeString`, #`rfc2109String`, #`rfc2965String`, #`rfc6265String`
 * Cookie2 support is gone (only Opera ever supported it but doesn't anymore)
 * `WADivTag` has been removed, `WAGenericTag` is used instead, if you have class extensions there you need to move them to `WAGenericTag`
 * parsing an URL with a non-numeric port (eg. `http://www.seaside.st:8x/`) will now signal a `WAInvalidUrlSyntaxError`
