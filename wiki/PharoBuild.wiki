= Introduction =

Pharo Build is a [http://www.hudson-ci.org/ Hudson] plugin to build [http://www.pharo.org Pharo] images.

= Features =
== Project Configuration ==
 * image name
 * script to execute
 * debug log file to watch for, when found will consider the build failed, kill the process and write the contents to the console
== Global Configuration ==
 * VM executable
 * VM parameters
 * before code
 * after code

= TODO =
 * I would remove the exclamation marks and just put empty lines in the "After Code" template, they are not really necessary.
 * validation of required parameters in global config
 * validation of required parameters in build config (image name)
