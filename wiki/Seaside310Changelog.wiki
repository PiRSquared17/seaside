#summary All the things that changed in 3.1.0.

= Introduction =
Seaside 3.1 contains the following changes.
 * The way session are tracked has been made customizable. The following strategies are supported out of the box:
  * query fields
  * cookies of the browser supports it, query fields otherwise
  * _new_: cookies only
  * _new_: cookies for browsers and IPs for web crawlers, inspired by [http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2011/05/18/crawler-session-manager-valve Crawler Session Manager Valve] for Tomcat
  * _new_: ssl session id, needs special server support, right now only works with AJP
 * All the deprecated methods and classes have been removed.
 * Session continuations have been made subclasses of WARequestHandler

= Bugs Fixed =
 * Issue 325:	Force the use of cookies
 * Issue 592:	investigate tracking sessions by SSL session id
 * Issue 626: 	Allow platforms to implement custom encoders for speed
 * Issue 663: 	Remove default nil option from WAListAttribute
 * Issue 679:   Make SessionContinuations into subclasses of RequestHandler 

= Changes =
== Server Adaptors == 
 * if your server supports access to the SSL session id implement {{{#sslSessionIdFor:}}}

== Porters ==
 * {{{GRPlatform >> #includesUnsafeUrlCharacter:}}} and {{{#includesUnsafeXmlCharacter:}}} are no longer used. They are replaced by {{{GRPlatform >> #xmlEncoderOn:}}}, {{{#urlEncoderOn:}}} and {{{#urlEncoderOn:codec:}}} which allow you to answer custom implementations. You don't have to do this, the old implementations are provided as default implementations.
 * There is a new {{{#sourceFileEncoding}}} method on {{{GRPlatform}}} that is used by the file library to save the conent of uploaded files into methods. It defaults to ISO-8859-1 which is what was hard coded in Seaside 3.0.
