WAAbstractFileLibrary has been introduced which acts as a base for the old file libraries derived from WAFileLibrary and introduces a new subclass WAFileMetadataLibrary. WAFileM​etadataLibrary supports resources with paths, which is handy when, for example, the javascript or css in a file library expects its supporting images to be in subdirectories such as img/xxxx.png. WAFileMetadataLi​brary also records the original filenames so that when you #deployFiles from the file library on a production server, the exported files will maintain their original names and paths.

WAFileMetadataLibrary allows for the easy integration of libraries such as Twitter Bootstrap.

There's a new method for recursing a sub-directory tree to add all the files and record their relative paths:

`MYWAFileMetadataDerivedFileLib​rary recursivelyAddAllFilesIn: '/var/www/files/​twitterbootstrap'`

The work was based on a previous implementation by Avi Shefi with ideas from Boris Popov.
