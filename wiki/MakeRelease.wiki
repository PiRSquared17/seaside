#summary Release Early. Release Often

 # Load all the latest code from `http://www.squeaksource.com/Seaside29/` and `http://www.squeaksource.com/Seaside29LGPL`.
   # Run the unit tests and make sure they all pass. 
   # Click through the functional test suite using the all server adaptors and all different encodings.
 # Load `Package-Dependencies` from `http://source.lukas-renggli.ch/unsorted`. Generate the graph `PDPackageAnalizer saveSeasideDependencyGraph` and make sure the dependencies are valid. Export as SVG and PNG versions and include them with the release.
 # Load `Package-Builder` from `http://source.lukas-renggli.ch/unsorted`. Go to `PBSource>>#seaside` and update the version information. Evaluate the code in the comment of that method to gerate the release locally.
 # Test the distribution locally by going to `http://localhost:8080/seaside/builder`.
 # Copy the generated distribution to `builder.seaside.st:/srv/builder.seaside.st/web/distribution`, make sure that the owner is set to `www-data`.
 # Using VNC connect to the builder image at builder.seaside.st:5901. 
   # Update to the latest version of `Package-Builder`.
   # Evaluate `PBBuilderComponent initializeDistribution; flush` to register and reload the model.
   # Inspect `PBBuilderComponent distributions` to see if the model gets properly loaded.
   # Test and save the image.
 # Announce the release in the mailing list.
 # Repeat forever.
