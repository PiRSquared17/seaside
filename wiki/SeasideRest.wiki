#summary Provides a short overview over Seaside-REST.

= Introduction =

Seaside-REST allows you to easily dispatch to methods based on several properties of an HTTP request. Think of pattern matching in functional programming languages for an HTTP request. This can be used to write RESTful web application.


= Details =

You start by sublassing either {{{WARestfulFilter}}} or {{{WARestfulHandler}}} and putting methods there. There are several request properties that you can dispatch on:

== HTTP Method ==
Every method must have a pragma that indicates the HTTP method on which it should be invoked.
{{{
indexHtml
   <GET>
}}}

== URL path ==

== Query Arguments ==

== Conent-Type ==

== Accept ==
