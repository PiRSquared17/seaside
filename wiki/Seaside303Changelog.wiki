# All the things that changed in 3.0.3.

= Introduction =
Seaside 3.0.3 is a not yet released bug fix release for Seaside 3.0.


= Details =

The following bugs were fixed:
  * Issue 607: 	No adapter can be stared if two stopped adapters are on the same port
  * Issue 609: 	Consider not using #subStrings: in WAUrl>>addToPath:
  * Issue 611:	Auto Reload of a page and memory consumption
  * Issue 619:	error detected on WATemporaryFile
  * Issue 621: 	error uploading file

In addition the following improvements were made:
  * Reaping of expired sessions now happens every _n_ (default 10) session creations instead of every _n_ session accesses. This is back to the behavior of Seaside 2.8. If you want the behavior of previous Seaside 3 releases use {{{WARetrievalIntervalReapingStrategy}}}. {{{WARetrievalIntervalReapingStrategy}}} reaps on access as well as creation (_new_). Already registered applications will not be migrated and continue to use {{{WARetrievalIntervalReapingStrategy}}}. To use the new {{{WAAccessIntervalReapingStrategy}}} they have to be registered again or the configuration of the cache has to be updated.
